Python-based Simulation of COVID-19 Spread: A Markov Chain Approach

Overview

This project is a Python-based simulation model for COVID-19 spread, incorporating population demographics and age structure data. It uses a Markov Chain approach to model infection progression over time, providing insights into disease dynamics and potential public health interventions.

Features

✅ Simulates COVID-19 spread using Markov Chain principles

✅ Incorporates real-world demographic and age-group data

✅ Outputs detailed infection trends in CSV format

✅ Visualizes results through graphs and plots

✅ Adjustable transition probabilities to model different scenarios

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Modeling Approach: Markov Chains

Data Format: CSV for result storage
